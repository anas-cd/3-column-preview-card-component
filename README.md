## Overview
I took this challenge to improve my skills using flexbox and css syntax of sass, for the first time I actually finished the challenge faster than I thought which was so gratifying. ^_^
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

other than the hover states I added an active state which gets activated when the button gets clicked.
